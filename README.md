# Dan's AOC solutions

My attempts at solving Advent of Code. I started committing to repository during AoC 2021 and I decided to
use Rust. In the meantime as I'm waiting for new challanges, I'm also solving AoCs from previous years. For
now I'm sticking to Rust everywhere, but I might change to some other random language.
